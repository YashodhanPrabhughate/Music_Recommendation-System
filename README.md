## Music Recommendation System


The music recommendation system can predict and then offer the appropriate songs to the user based on the characteristics or features of music the user listens to.



### Model :

The algortithm used here is K-Means clustering and one of the methods from distance measures is used i.e. Manhattan Distance, which we have used to calculate
the distance/similarities between the song entered by the user and the songs in the dataset. 

The features used to find the similarities are :

     'acousticness', 'artists', 'danceability’,
     'duration_ms', 'energy', 'explicit', 'id’, 
     'instrumentalness', 'key', 'liveness’, 
     'loudness', 'mode', 'name', 'popularity’, 
     'release_date', 'speechiness', 'tempo’, 
     'valence', 'year'
